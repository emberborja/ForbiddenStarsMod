# ForbiddenStarsMod
Lua mod for Table Top Simulator

This mod is found in the Steam Workshop, for the game Table Top Simulator. This mod recreates the game Forbidden Stars by downloading assets from the game and is scripted using Lua!

Once you have subscribed to the mod, the Steam client should download the content automatically. You can play the mod by using the in-game menue in TTS.

## Instructions for using the mod in TTS
In a TTS game, by default the game menu will be at the top of the window and the far left option is labled "Games" and has two dice as an icon. Click on the "Games" button. 
You should see a menu of options of the left side of the modal that pops up. Classic, DLC, Workshop, Save & Load. You should click on "Workshop". The image for the mod is the in-game board and the name is "Forbidden Stars". Click that button to load the mod and play.

## Instructions for contributing to the mod
There is an in-game script editor in TTS under the "Modding" menu option which opens a dropdown with further options. Click on "Scriping" to open the script editor in game. 
I prefer to use an external text editor called Visual Studio Code. This is a YouTube vidoe with instrucitons on how to use it to mod in TTS => https://youtu.be/z9rxVf3XvLk
